# Social Media Dashboard

## Project Description

The main objective of this project was to challenge my CSS skills by building a simple dashboard for a user to view his/her social account activities. Decided to build this design using SCSS because it provided me a more coherent and structured way to write the CSS code. This project tested my skills in CSS, especially positioning of the elements. Nevertheless, this challenge really improved my CSS skills. Gulp was used to simplify the whole design process by automating tasks like refreshing the browser while making changes to the design files.

## Technologies used

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- GulpJS
